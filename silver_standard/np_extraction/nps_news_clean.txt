the interesting thing

at least but not rock
its the Streets
a good claim

This whole debate
Its a stupid phrase
any other name
the inner cities
a bass heavy sound system
a single black artist

such a massively misunderstood term
And so what
a lazy term

nearly all music
Surely the point
an urban music category
a certain type
an inner city
a music genre
the MOBO Awards
The very term 'Music
the Asian Music Awards
the issue colourblind
a redundant new debate
a new term
the various strains
just a word
the industry clumping
any neat marketing niche
the music channels
all the TV broadcasters
some 'urban' music
a black man
at least the statements
the key executives
The real question
Urban Music Awards
why not Brits
the Urban awards
the 'Urban' banner
the real issue
Ms Stone's talent
the hardest thing
reasonable, intelligent comments
That entire category
Best British R & B act
a nonsense term - music
almost all bands
some weird implication
all black people
a heavy metal band
our working life
an urban environment
the new name
the urban life
a white rock band
a fantastic voice
what other reason
All this "urban" and other such categorisation
just the red-tape
a crap, meaningless, politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term
